# Time-lapse quantification

How germquant processes a live-imaging series one timepoint at a time, what it writes, and how the
series-level tables are laid out. The design this follows is [DESIGN_timelapse.md](DESIGN_timelapse.md)
(sections 2 and 6); the scope decision is in
[PROPOSAL_general_modular_tool.md](PROPOSAL_general_modular_tool.md), section 11. The first dataset is
the October 2026 GFP::SYP-2 series on the lab NAS (25 timepoints every 300 s, 76 or 66 planes at 0.2 um,
brightfield plus EGFP, 2720 x 2720 at 0.108 um, about 2.25 GB per timepoint).

Status: the per-timepoint loop, the series record and the `series_summary` table are implemented (this
page). Registration (`germquant register`), tracking through an external tracker, the biologist
validation (`germquant track-validate`) and the live-imaging profile (EGFP as `central_element`, no DNA
stain, a model trained on GFP slices) come in later packages; their tables are declared already, see
"Series tables" below.

## Running a series

```
germquant run SERIES.nd2 --config config/config.yaml --out results/SERIES --t all
germquant run SERIES.nd2 --profile live_syp2 --out results/SERIES --t 0-24 --resume
germquant run SERIES.nd2 --config config/config.yaml --out results/SERIES --t 7 --xy-stride 4
```

`--t` names the timepoints: `all` (every timepoint of the file), one index (`7`), or an inclusive range
(`0-24`). Without `--t` a run is the single-image run it always was: a file with a T axis is read at
its first timepoint, as before, and nothing below applies. `--xy-stride`, `--z-range` and the
`--no-<stage>` switches apply to every timepoint of the series.

What happens, per timepoint k:

1. The reader loads only that timepoint's planes (`read_stack(path, t=k)`; the nd2 dask array is
   indexed before anything is computed, so a 56 GB series never comes into memory as a whole).
2. `process_image` runs every enabled stage on that stack, exactly as it does on a fixed image, into
   the folder `results/SERIES/t<NNN>/` (three digits, `t007`).
3. The image id is `<stem>_t<NNN>`, with a single underscore. The design columns (genotype, sex,
   treatment, replicate, acquisition_date) are parsed from the raw stem first, so they read the same as
   they would for a fixed image with that name. Every per-image file in the folder carries the suffixed
   id: `<stem>_t007__nuclei.csv`, `__spots.csv`, `__image_summary.csv`, `__montage.png`,
   `__nuclei_labels.tif`, `__stages.json`, `__done.json` and the rest of the fixed-image file set, plus
   the folder's own `run_manifest.json`. No per-image table gains a column.
4. `t_index` and `t_seconds` (the acquisition time of the timepoint from the file header, when it has
   one) are written into the run geometry of `run_manifest.json` and `<id>__stages.json` and into the
   completion marker `<id>__done.json`. They are written only when `--t` was given, so the markers of
   a fixed image keep their exact keys.

Next to the timepoint folders the loop keeps two series-level records:

* `results/SERIES/<stem>__series.json`: the timepoints requested, done and failed (each failure with
  its flags), `period_s` and `t_seconds` from the header, the elapsed seconds per timepoint,
  `config_hash`, `pipeline_version`, `git_sha`, the run geometry and the enabled stages. It is
  rewritten after every timepoint, so an interrupted series leaves an honest record of what is on disk
  (`complete` is false until the loop finishes).
* `results/SERIES/<stem>__series_summary.csv` and `.parquet`: one row per requested timepoint, see
  "Series tables".

A timepoint whose run raises (an unreadable frame, a segmentation that blows up) is recorded with an
`EXCEPTION:<type>: <message>` flag and the loop goes on, as `germquant batch` does for an image; its
folder has no completion marker, its summary row has `qc_pass` false and empty counts. A stage that
fails without stopping the image (`<stage>:FAILED_<type>` in `qc_flags`) is a finished timepoint whose
marker lists the failed stage. The exit code of `germquant run --t` is 0 when at least one requested
timepoint finished and 1 when none did.

`--resume` skips every requested timepoint whose completion marker matches the current config hash,
enabled stages, xy stride, z range, timepoint index and segment stage (model file and Cellpose
version), the rule `germquant batch --resume` uses, and reprocesses the rest, including timepoints
whose marker lists a failed stage. The summary rows of skipped timepoints are read back from their
`__image_summary.csv`, so the series summary is complete after a resume; their elapsed times are
carried over from the previous series record.

Self-test, from the design: `germquant run SERIES.nd2 --t 7 --out A` writes the same `A/t007/`
folder, file for file, as `germquant run SERIES.nd2 --t all --out B` writes under `B/t007/` (only the
timestamps and elapsed times differ). The test suite checks this on a synthetic three-timepoint series
with a planted drift (`tests/test_timelapse_series.py`).

`germquant collect results/` stacks the timepoint folders like any images (their ids carry the
`_t<NNN>` suffix, so `batch_nuclei.csv` and `batch_summary.csv` hold every timepoint) and, when any
`<stem>__series_summary.csv` is present under the root, stacks those into `batch_series_summary.csv`.
A results tree without a series gets no such file.

From code, `germquant.api.process_series(path, cfg, out, timepoints="all", xy_stride=1, z_range=None,
resume=False)` is the function the command runs; it returns the series id, the requested, done and
failed timepoints, the record and the summary DataFrame. `api.parse_timepoints("0-24", n_timepoints)`
turns a `--t` value into indices. A single timepoint as a plain image, with the suffixed id but no
`t<NNN>` folder and no series record, is `api.process_image(path, cfg, out, t=7)`.

What the reader provides (the contract shared with the reader package): `read_stack(path, t=None)`
keeps today's behaviour (a T axis is read at index 0); `read_stack(path, t=k)` reads timepoint k and
raises ValueError when k is out of range, or when the file has no T axis and k is not 0 (so `--t 0` on
a fixed image is a one-timepoint series, which is how the loop is checked on a local fixed `.nd2`).
`read_nd2_metadata` reports `n_timepoints` (1 for a fixed image), `period_s` (from the experiment's
TimeLoop) and `t_seconds` (per timepoint, or None). `read_image` / `read_image_metadata` pass `t` on
for the other formats.

Timing: one timepoint of the October series is a full fixed-image run (segmentation of a 76 plane
stack on the GPU, SpotMAX when a `foci` role is mapped), so budget the single-image time per
timepoint; 25 timepoints run overnight. Start with `--t 0 --xy-stride 4` to check the profile and the
channel roles, then `--t all`.

## The series record

`<stem>__series.json` keys: `series_id` (the raw stem), `file_path`, `config_hash`,
`pipeline_version`, `git_sha`, `n_timepoints` (of the file), `period_s`, `t_seconds` (list or null),
`xy_stride`, `z_range`, `enabled_stages`, `resume`, `requested` (indices), `done` (indices with a
completion marker, processed now or skipped by a resume), `failed` (`{"t_index", "flags"}` objects),
`elapsed_s` (seconds per timepoint, keyed by the index as text), `timepoints` (one object per
requested timepoint: `t_index`, `t_seconds`, `image_id`, `out_dir`, `status` done or failed,
`resumed`, `qc_pass`, `qc_flags`, `failed_stages`, `elapsed_s`), `started`, `finished`, `complete`.

## Series tables

`schema.SERIES_TABLES` declares five tables, one file per series, written next to the timepoint folders
as `<stem>__<table>.csv` (and `.parquet`). They live outside `schema.TABLES` on purpose: the stage
tests force every `TABLES` entry through `process_image`, and a timepoint folder holds exactly the
fixed-image file set. The schema rule is the same, append only. Every row carries `SERIES_META`
(`series_id`, `file_path`, the design columns, `n_timepoints`, `period_s`, `pipeline_version`,
`git_sha`, `config_hash`, `run_timestamp`); the join to a timepoint's tables is `image_id`
(`series_id + "_t" + three digits`), and on to a nucleus with `(image_id, nucleus_id)`. The track id
is `time_track_id`; `track_id` already means an SC fragment in `sc_tracks`.

| table | written by | one row per | columns |
|---|---|---|---|
| `series_summary` | this package (`process_series`) | requested timepoint | `t_index`, `t_seconds`, `image_id`, `n_nuclei`, `n_germline_nuclei`, `mean_spots`, `qc_pass`, `qc_flags`, `elapsed_s`, then `sig_<role>_bg` and `sig_<role>_snr` for each channel role the series resolves (the signal_qc stage's background and signal-to-noise), then `SERIES_META` |
| `register_shifts` | registration package (`germquant register`) | timepoint | the step against the reference frame and the accumulated shift to t0 in microns, the brightfield cross-check and its disagreement flag, whether the step was capped, the median nearest-neighbour displacement before and after, stride, upsample factor, method |
| `track_points` | tracking package | object per timepoint | `time_track_id`, `t_index`, `t_seconds`, `image_id`, `nucleus_id`, raw and registered centroids, the step from the previous point, `is_gap`, `link_source`; nucleus measurements are joined on `(image_id, nucleus_id)` |
| `tracks` | tracking package | track | `n_points`, `n_gaps`, `t_start`, `t_end`, `is_full_length`, path length, net displacement, speed, signed axis velocity after the t0 sign alignment, SYP intensity slopes raw and median-normalised, SC length change, `link_source` |
| `track_validation` | `germquant track-validate` | hand-followed point | the biologist's point in raw-frame microns, the label it lands in and its track, the outcome (linked, segmentation_miss, switch, edge_missing), the validation set (holdout or constraint) and zone |

## What stays unchanged

The fixed-image path is byte-identical: `process_image` without `t` makes the same reader call, the
same image id, the same tables and the same marker keys as before; `tests/test_golden.py` runs the
synthetic goldens unchanged, and `config/config.yaml`, the study configs and the channel maps are not
edited. Every new key is read with a code default; the new schema entries are appended, not inserted.
