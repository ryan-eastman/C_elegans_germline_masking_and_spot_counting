# Time-lapse quantification

Status: the reader side is implemented (this page, "Reading one timepoint"); the loop over a series, its
resume logic and the command line switch are the next package and are described in
[DESIGN_timelapse.md](DESIGN_timelapse.md). Nothing on this page changes a fixed image: its id, its
tables, its stage record and its completion marker are byte for byte what they were, and
tests/test_golden.py still gates that.

The first dataset is the October 2026 GFP::SYP-2 series on the lab NAS: 25 timepoints 300 s apart, 76 (or
66 in the second worm) planes at 0.2 um, two channels (Brightfield, EGFP), 2720 x 2720 pixels at 0.108 um,
56 GB (49 GB) per file. One timepoint is a 2.25 GB stack at full resolution.

## Reading one timepoint

### The keyword

Every reader takes `t`, the index of the timepoint to read, and returns the usual `(C, Z, Y, X)` Stack of
that timepoint with its voxel size, so every stage sees exactly what it sees for a fixed image:

```python
from germquant.io import read_stack, read_image, read_nd2_metadata, read_image_metadata

st = read_stack("series.nd2", t=7)                       # timepoint 7, full resolution
st = read_stack("series.nd2", t=7, xy_stride=4, z_range=(10, 60))   # sub-sampled as always
st = read_image("series.ome.tif", t=7)                   # the same through the format dispatcher
st.t_index                                               # 7 (None when no timepoint was asked for)
```

* `t=None`, the default, is the old behaviour: a T axis takes index 0, as it always did, and a file
  without a T axis is read by exactly the code that read it before. `t=0` on a fixed image is allowed
  and gives the same stack, so a loop can treat a fixed image as a one-timepoint series.
* `t` out of range, or `t` other than 0 on a file without a T axis, raises ValueError before any pixel is
  read, with the number of timepoints in the message. A non-integer `t` is a ValueError too.
* Only that timepoint's planes are read. nd2 chunks its lazy array one frame per (T, Z) with all channels
  in the frame, and the T index is applied before compute, so a 76-plane timepoint touches 76 of the
  1900 frames of the file. `xy_stride` and `z_range` cut the read down further as they do for a fixed image.
* Formats other than `.nd2` (OME-TIFF, CZI, LIF, OME-Zarr through bioio) take the same keyword; the
  timepoint is selected on the lazy array. Without `t`, a file with more than one time point still raises
  UnsupportedImageError, as it did before, and the message now says to pass `t`.

### What the header says about time

`read_nd2_metadata` and `read_image_metadata` return three keys besides the old ones:

| key | meaning | fixed image |
|---|---|---|
| `n_timepoints` | number of timepoints (the size of the T axis) | 1 |
| `period_s` | the programmed interval between timepoints in seconds, from the experiment's TimeLoop (`periodMs`); None for a non-equidistant loop with more than one phase | None |
| `t_seconds` | one value per timepoint: the recorded time stamp of its first plane in seconds since the acquisition started, as NIS-Elements stores it per frame | None |

`t_seconds` is what the camera recorded, not `k * period_s`: in the October series the steps run from
299.5 to 300.5 s (median 300.005 s), and the first stamp is 0.358 s, not 0. It is read from one small
per-frame metadata chunk per timepoint, no pixels. For the bioio formats `period_s` and `t_seconds` are
None for now (not read yet); `n_timepoints` comes from the header. Passing `t` to a metadata call only
checks that the timepoint exists.

`germquant info series.nd2` prints a `timepoints : 25 every 300 s` line for a series and nothing new for
a fixed image.

### Running one timepoint through the pipeline

```python
from germquant import api

res = api.run("series.nd2", profile="n2_sc", out="results/series", t=7)
res["image_id"]          # "series_t007"
```

`process_image(path, cfg, out_dir, t=7)` and `api.run(..., t=7)` run every enabled stage, unchanged, on
that timepoint's stack. Three things differ from a fixed image, and only when `t` is given:

* The image id becomes `<stem>_t<NNN>` (three digits, one underscore): `series.nd2` at `t=7` is
  `series_t007`. The design columns (acquisition date, genotype, treatment, sex, replicate) are parsed
  from the raw file stem first, so they are what they would be for the whole file, and the suffix is added
  afterwards. Every per-image file is named from the suffixed id (`series_t007__nuclei.csv`,
  `series_t007__stages.json`, `series_t007__done.json`, the montage, the label images), so the
  timepoints of one series can share a folder.
* `t_index` (the index) and `t_seconds` (that timepoint's recorded stamp, None when the file carries
  none) are written to the run geometry in `run_manifest.json`, to `<id>__stages.json` and to the
  completion marker `<id>__done.json`. No table gets a new column: `image_id` is the key, as it is for
  every other per-image file.
* `germquant run` has no `--t` switch yet; it arrives with the series loop. Use the API, or
  `process_image`, until then.

tests/test_timelapse_reader.py checks that a timepoint run and a fixed run on the same stack write
identical tables apart from `image_id` and the time stamp, and that the fixed run's manifest, stage
record and marker contain no timepoint fields.

### Cost on the real series

Read-only check on 2026-10-09, workstation reading the 56 GB file over the lab network, nothing copied:

* Header (`read_nd2_metadata`): 0.28 s, no pixel frame read; `n_timepoints` 25, `period_s` 300.0,
  25 time stamps from 0.358 to 7200.367 s. The second worm (49 GB, 66 planes) header: 0.14 s.
* `read_stack(t=7, xy_stride=8)`: 25 s. Exactly the 76 frames of timepoint 7 were read (sequence
  indices 532 to 607, no other timepoint touched), 2.25 GB of pixels at about 90 MB/s over the network;
  the stack in memory is 35 MB at stride 8. Resident memory after the read was 0.36 GB; the peak working
  set was 2.64 GB, which is the memory-mapped file pages of the 76 frames (nd2 copies each frame out of
  the map while it is open, and the map goes away when the read finishes).
* At full resolution one timepoint is 2.25 GB in memory, like a fixed gonad stack; the read time is set
  by the network, not by the stride, since a whole frame is read before it is strided. A 25-timepoint
  loop reads for about 10 minutes over the network; a local copy of the file is the cheaper way to iterate.

## Running a series

To be written with the series loop (DESIGN_timelapse.md, section 2): `process_series` over the timepoints
of one file with per-timepoint resume, the `<stem>__series.json` record, and
`germquant run STACK.nd2 --t all|7|0-24 [--resume]`.
